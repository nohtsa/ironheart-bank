# TC Inventory:
TC Inventory is a personal project tool I made to help index and keep track of treasure cards over several accounts.

## Link
https://nohtsa.github.io/tc-inventory/

## Features:
- Keep tabs on treasure card amounts and which characters hold which.
- Add and remove any quantities
- Logged treasure cards work as links to the wizard101 wiki of that treasure card.
- See profile images of treasure cards as you go. **(Note: this feature is only allowed on the offline version.)**

## How to use:

Enter an identifying name for an account to start.

**(Note: If you are uncomfortable using your actual account details, anything can be used to indentify an account as long as you understand it. No information is saved or uploaded to any external source. All information is stored locally in your save file.)**

### Using normal treasure cards
If you would like the link feature to work with your save file the name of the treasure card must match the spelling of it's wiki counterpart. Which simply means the first letter of each word must be capitalized.
If you aren't sure about the spelling of a card then simply find it's wiki page and copy/paste the spelling from there into the treasure card form.

### Using spellement treasure cards

If you are going to enter a spellement treasure card, and you want the link feature to work the name of the treasurecard needs to be formatted correctly. The spelling is identical to the wizard101 wiki spelling of treasure cards. (I.e. "Dark Sprite (Tier 2b)")

As you fill out the account and character sections, the first treasure card form will open. The variation field is not required, and is only to signify which pack the treasure card came from. You'll know when you've successfully filled out the first treasure card form when the submit button appears. At the same time the second treasure card form will open. If the second form isn't filled out completely the submit button will disappear. Each form after follows the same rules.

As you submit the treasure card forms the inventory table and total table will populate with the information.

After submitting the form will automaticcally empty itself, but keep the account and character information for continuous submissions. If you use the reset forms button it will clear everything, but the last account entered, for moving to different characters.

When you are done entering treasure cards on the top left of the page are the save options.

### Saving/Loading
- The load button will prompt you to pick your save file from your computer
- The save button will download your save with the date and time to help keep track of saves

- There is a custom name box if you wish to further differentiate your save files

- Lastly there is a public save option. This option works the same as the previous save option, but this one will remove any account information, and when loaded will disable editing. This option is for those who wish to share their inventories with others without disclosing personal information. **(Note: The custom name box applies to this option)**

## Treasure card profiles **(Offline version only)**

If you are using the offline version downloaded here then as you fill out the treasure card forms the profile box will show images of the treasure cards you enter as you fill out the form.
